Hello to all of you . My Name Is Salah Am from jerusalem , married + 4 Kids , I work as Crane operator , once upon a time i was able to earn as mush as someone who works in hightech that's the only
period of my life that worth to mention in my cv , unfortenatly that situation it didnt last so much so i started to look for the hightech salaries in other places whithout making any progress , 
so i decided to go the point directly to the point and be with you here , it's not my first step actully there was some attempts before , udemy , coursera , youtube and that's it , my story is the 
most shortest one , hopefully i will get a longer one to tell about one day , thank for listening wishes the best for all of you
